# What is VCS. Why we need VCS.
	VCS features.

GIT is called as 
	version controll system(VCS).
	Revisioned controll system(RCS).
	Source code management(SCM).

#
GIT Installation (Ubuntu):
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install git

Verify Installation:
	which git
	git --version


GIT Uninstallation:
$ sudo apt-get remove git

Git Architecture Diagram

	------------------------------------------------------	
	. (Souce area) | ..(Stage) | .git (Local Repository) |
		       |           |			     |
	------------------------------------------------------

	- Centralized VCS -  Ex: CVS/SVN/Clearcase/Perforce
	- Distributed VCS -  Ex: GIT/Bitkeeper

Day-2
======
Creating remote repository in github
===============
1. create an account in github.com
	URL: https://github.com

2. login github.com with your credentials. 	
	click on "new repository" --> give a name "DevOps_Classes" --> "create reopository" 

3. copy the repo URL from Github:
	https://github.com/swapnilmahajan-git/DevOps_Classes.git

4. Clone the source code from remote repository using 'git clone' command
	$ git clone https://github.com/swapnilmahajan-git/DevOps_Classes.git

5. 	$ cd DevOps_Classes 

		(Note - observe ".git" folder. ".git" is called as "Local Reposiotory".)

6. Create some sample code and submit the code to remote repo.

	    $ touch Login.java
		or 
	    $ vim Login.java  (Note -> create file using command or go to directory and create new document)

	    $ git status
		- check the status of files.

	    $ git add Login.java
		- Move file from (.)source area to (..)stage area 

	    $ git status
		- check the status of files.

		Note :- If you are doing First time commit then apply  config --global command

	    $ git commit Login.java -m "login module code"
		- move from stage area to .git area

	    $ git status
		- check the status of files.

	    $ git push
 		- move from .git to reomte area.

	    $ git log 
		- check log of the commit  

#
- Git Commit structure
	User/Email
	Timestamp
	Commit message
	
#
SHA / Version / Revison


#
Setting up mandatory configurations:
=============================================
$ git config --global user.name "swapnil"
$ git config --global user.email "abc@gmail.com"

$ git config --global credential.helper cache

Check the configurations using below command
$ git config --list

Git stores all configurations in below file
"/home/swapnil/.gitconfig"



Day-3
======
# Understand Git Jargon.
	- Remote Repository --- github server
	- Working Directory ---- (.)
	- Local Repository  ----- (.git)
	- Stage/"Staging Index" ---- (..)


#It is remote repo url for clone the files.
	$ git remote -v
 
#If you want downlod remote repository (ie. folder) then apply this commnad (It is first time activity).
	$ git clone <repo-url>

#If you want to download modified content from remote repo then apply this command, after git pull your modified changes comes in source area.
	$ git pull

#If you want to download modified content from remote repo then apply this command, But you dont want to merge modified content in your source area then apply this command
	$ git fetch

# Skip staging
	git commit -am "submit all pending changes"
Note: If you want to skip the staging, you need to commit all pending changes.


# Creating up Local repository
1. create/initialize a local repository with 'git init' command
	$ git init <folder-name>
	$ git remote add <folder-name> <repo-url>
	$ git push <folder-name>
	$ git push --set-upstream <folder-name> master



2. Observe the local repository
	$ ls -a 
		(you can see the .git folder. this is called the "local repository")

3.create some source code.. ex: vim Login.java

4.Adding the file to STAGE.
	$ git add <filename>

5.Commiting the file to local repository
	$ git commit <filename> -m "lgoin module code"

6.Check the log of Login.java using log command.
	$ git log <filename>


Day-4
======
# History - Deep Dive
	$ git log <filename>
	$ git log

	Options:
		- git log -n2
		- git log --author="swapnil"
		- git log --since="2016/12/13"
		- git log --until="2016/12/13"
		- git log --grep="DB code"		
		- git log --oneline (if we want to see logs on high level that time we can use this command ie. only commit ids and msg)

#Qn.
Show me all logs committed by user "Ram" AND has a commit message "math function" in it.

$ git log --author="Ram" --grep="math function"


Day-5
=====
# GIT Commands

1.  
	$ git status 

	$ git diff <filename> (if file is already present in remote repo and we are something modify in this file that time we can use this command)
		    (Note :- This command is useful on existing file).

	$ git diff --staged <filename> (if the file is added (i.e git add coomand) into the stage area then you want see the changes that time we can use this command)

	$ git diff  089871935..fc894a6bf6d2e (if we want to see difference between two files)(use commit ids).


2. Deleting a file

	A.) $ git rm <filename> (NOte:- If we are remove a file from repo, then you must commit it again this file).
	    $ git commit <filename> -m "comment"
       
	Suppose if we want the deleted file again then use the below command 
	
	B.) $ git checkout shavalue(i.e 123abc..)
 		(Note :- Deletion is not permantaly in git we can get any file anytime from previous version)


4. Renaming a file/folder
	A.) $ git mv Login.java Login1.java
		$ git commit -m "rename Login"
		$ git push
			
#
Carry the history for new file from old file
	- $ git log --follow Login.java


Day-6
=======
# BRANCHING
	A. What is a branch?
	B. Why and When we create a branch?
	C. Branching Stratogy overview


# List all the branches
	$ git branch
	
# Creating a new branch
	$ git branch dev_1.2.3

# List all remote branches
	$ git branch -r

		
# Switching from one branch to another
	$ git checkout dev_1.2.3
		
# Creating and switching to a newly created branch
	$ git checkout -b dev_1.2.4

#
HEAD

HEAD is a pointer in git which
	- Always points to the latest commit in the repository
	- Always points to tip of the current reposiotory
	- Always points to parent of the next commit


Day-7
======

# Undoing the changes:

# undo/revert local changes from source area
	$ git checkout <filename>

# Unstage the changes from STAGE area
	$ git reset HEAD <filename>

# move changes from .git to source area
	$ git reset --mixed HEAD~1

# move changes from .git to stage area
	$ git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Remove changes from everywhere
	$ git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Show all the files with content difference that are modified as part of a commit
git show <SHA>
git show <SHA-VALUE>


# List only files that are committed as part of a revision.
	$ git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r <SHA-VALUE>


Day-8
======
Merging:
=========
# FAST-FORWARD MERGE

BEFORE MERGE:
-------------
			master
			 |
----C1--C2---C3
			 |
			 ----------C4----C5  
								dev_1.2.3
		
AFTER MERGE:
-------------
 			     			master
			     			  |
----C1----C2---C3------C4----C5
		             		  |
			     			dev_1.2.3


Excercise:
===========
# List all the branches
	$ git branch

# Create a new branch
	$ git branch dev_1.2.3

# Add some changes to newely created branch i.e dev_1.2.3
	$ Modify/Add some files	
	$ git add	
	$ git commit 

# Now merge the code from dev_1.2.3 to master branch
  Before merge, make sure that you are on target branch i.e master (source branch: dev_1.2.3)
	$ git checkout master

# You have master code in source since currently checkout branch is master. Now bring/merge the changes from dev_1.2.3 to master by running below command. 
Git merge command merges the changes from dev_1.2.3 to master.
Verify the chages.
	$ git merge dev_1.2.3

# Abservce the changes from dev_1.2.3 into master branch.

# git push


MERGING W/ CONFLICT:
=================

# List all the branches
	$ git branch

# Create a new branch
	$ git branch dev_1.2.3


# Take a file which is common in master and dev_1.2.3 branch.
  ex: Login.java

# Make sure Login.java has below content in master and dev_1.2.3 branch
	Login.java
		line#5 --> int a = 10;
	
# To create a conflict situation, we need to modify same line in two branches with different content.

	ex: Login.java (master)
			line#5 --> int a =100;
		
		Login.java (dev_1.2.3)
			line#5 --> int a = 200;


# Now merge the code from dev_1.2.3 to master branch
  Before merge, make sure that you are on target branch i.e master (source branch: dev_1.2.3)
	$ git checkout master

# You have master code now, since currently checkout branch is master. Now bring/merge the changes from dev_1.2.3 to master by running below command. 
Git merge command merges the changes from dev_1.2.3 to master.

	$ git merge dev_1.2.3

# Run git status command to list conflict file

# Resolve the conflict and commit the merge

# Run git push command to move the merge to Remote.


# What is Conflict:
If two users modify the same file in source and target branches and if the same line has different content, git can't decide which user's code it has to take. we call this situation as conflict.

# How do you resolve the conflict: 
- Open the conflict file--> remove conflict markers-->select the right content. (<<<<<<<<   >>>>>>>>>)
- git add
- git commit
- git push
